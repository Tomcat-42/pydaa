# DAA Python Wrapper

This is a Python package that provides a wrapper for the
[DAA C++ library](https://github.com/Tomcat-42/daa). It allows users to access
the functionality of the C++ library from Python code.

The DAA library is a fast and efficient library that provides a set of
algorithms for data analysis. The Python wrapper provides a convenient interface
for Python developers who want to use the DAA library in their projects.

## Installation

The DAA Python Wrapper can be installed via pip:

```python
pip install daa
```

Note that in order to use the DAA Python Wrapper, the DAA C++ library must be
installed on your system. Instructions for building and installing the DAA
library can be found in the DAA repository.

## Usage

To use the DAA Python Wrapper in your Python code, start by importing the
module:

```python
import daa
...
```

From here, you can use the functions provided by the DAA library. The Python
wrapper provides an interface for all of the functions in the DAA library, so
consult the DAA documentation for details on how to use the individual
functions.
